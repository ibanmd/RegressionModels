# README for An Analysis of Fuel Efficiency by Transmission Type

This is the course project for the August 2014 offering of Regression Models by JHU in Coursera.  The R Markdown file in the repository was used to create a finished report which is published at http://rpubs.com/ibanmd/24960 .

#### Data
Information about the dataset can be found at this URL: http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html.  

The data was extracted from a 1974 issue of the automobile magazine *Motor Trend*, and lists fuel consumption and other characteristics for 32 automobiles from the years 1973 and 1974.  Please see the Appendix for more information about the dataset.  Below is a table explaining the variables in the dataset along with the new names I gave them which were used throughout the R code.

| Column         | Variable Name (Original / New)      | Description  |
